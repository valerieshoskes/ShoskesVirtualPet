The foster simulator virtual pet allows a "winnable" virtual pet game 
where the pet gets to be adopted by a family. When you lose the game, the 
pet is taken by animal control to go to a suitable foster. 

First, a cat or dog is chosen and ASCII art is displayed. 

The stats are:

Nutrition:
Hydration:
Socialization:
Cleanliness:
Energy:

They all start at 5. Getting them all to 20 wins the game, 
dropping one to below 0 loses the game. 

From the main menu, you have the options to:

Provide Food
Provide Water
Play (low intensity)
Play (high intensity)
Clean up waste

These actions will increase or decrease the stats.
